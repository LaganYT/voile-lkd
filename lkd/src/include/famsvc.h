/* famsvc.h: the family IPC service. OWNER: sig (implementation in src/sig/famsvc.c).
 *
 * Purpose. Several modules must act on another host process of the same runtime family: sig queues a
 * signal there (Wine's server sends SIGUSR1 to client threads), mm reads and writes guest memory
 * (ptrace PEEK/POKE, /proc/<pid>/mem, process_vm_*), procfs lists descriptors and task state, ptrace
 * posts tracer commands. One service serves them all.
 *
 * Model. Every host process of the family runs one host service thread (not a guest thread: it has no
 * lkd_task, lkd_current() is NULL there, every host signal is blocked in it). It listens on a private
 * AF_UNIX stream socket "<dir>/<host pid>.s" inside a 0700 family directory. Modules register opcodes
 * at init (lkd_famsvc_register); a thread of any process of the family calls an opcode of another
 * process synchronously with a timeout (lkd_famsvc_call). A request and its response each carry a byte
 * payload (at most LKD_FAMSVC_MAX_PAYLOAD) and at most LKD_FAMSVC_MAX_FDS host descriptors
 * (SCM_RIGHTS). The receiver learns the caller's host pid from the kernel (LOCAL_PEERPID) and refuses
 * a peer with another uid (getpeereid).
 *
 * Directory. The environment variable LKD_FAMSVC_DIR names it. The first process of a family creates it
 * (mkdtemp under $TMPDIR, or /tmp when the path would not fit sun_path) and exports the variable; fork
 * children inherit it; a host re-exec of the runtime keeps it when the engine keeps the environment
 * (it must keep LKD_FAMSVC_DIR and LKD_FAMSVC_FD, as it keeps LKD_FAMILY_FD). Tests may set
 * LKD_FAMSVC_DIR to a directory of their own before lkd_init. The directory also holds the shared
 * futex table (futex.shm). The last process that leaves (lkd_famsvc_shutdown with no peer socket left)
 * removes the directory.
 *
 * Lifetime. Started by lkd_sig_init (so by lkd_init), restarted in the fork child by lkd_sig_fork_child
 * (new socket for the new host pid; inherited connections are closed), adopted after a host re-exec:
 * the listening socket is deliberately NOT close-on-exec and LKD_FAMSVC_FD="<fd>:<host pid>" names it,
 * so connections that arrive during the exec wait in the backlog and the new image serves them. A
 * process that exits without lkd_famsvc_shutdown leaves a stale socket file that refuses connections:
 * callers then get -LX_ESRCH.
 *
 * Handlers. A handler runs on the service thread, one request at a time per process, with no LKD lock
 * held. It must answer quickly (no blocking wait for a guest thread), must not take a lock that a guest
 * thread may hold across a blocking wait, and must NOT call lkd_famsvc_call itself (two services that
 * call each other would only end at the timeout). It reads req->data/len, may take ownership of a
 * received descriptor by setting req->fds[i] = -1 (the others are closed after the handler returns),
 * and fills resp->status (>= 0 or -LX_E*), resp->data (malloc'ed, freed by famsvc after sending) and
 * resp->fds (closed by famsvc after sending).
 *
 * Opcode numbers are a fixed ABI between the processes of a family (all run the same runtime build).
